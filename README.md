# WeatherX

The project will be realized with JDK 17, JavaFX and OpenWeather API. It will include all features and technologies, that we discussed in this course, including:
• Inheritance, overriding, multiple constructors
• Access permissions for classes, methods and variables
• Exception Handling

• Multi-Threading
• GUI via JavaFX

Everything will be documented with JavaDoc and a readme.md will be included with the final product.
